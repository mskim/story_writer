## Overview
`Story Writer` is a Ruby on Rails application that helps you craft, organize, and publish stories with chapters, sections, and photos. The web interface provides a clean editor for writing story content.

---

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mskim/story_writer.git
   cd story_writer
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```
3. **Set up the database**
   ```bash
   rails db:create db:migrate
   ```
4. **Run the server**
   ```bash
   rails server
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

---

## Creating a Story
1. Click **"New Story"** in the navigation bar.
2. Fill in the title, description, and select a cover photo.
3. Save the story – you’ll be taken to the story dashboard where you can add chapters.

## Editing Content
### How to edit a story, chapter, or section
1. **Navigate** to the item you want to edit (Story → Chapters → Sections).
2. Click the **"Edit"** button (usually found in the top-right or near the item).
3. You will be taken to the **Edit** page where you can modify the fields directly.
4. Make your changes:
   - **Title** – plain text input.
   - **Content** – rich‑text editor (supports markdown).
   - **Photos** – drag‑and‑drop or use the upload button.
5. Press **"Save"** to persist changes.

### Common reasons you might not see the editor
- **You are not logged in** – the app requires authentication for write access.
- **The item is locked** – some stories are marked as *published*; you must unpublish first.
- **JavaScript failed to load** – if the rich text editor looks like a plain text box, try refreshing the page.
- **Browser extensions** – ad‑blockers can interfere with the editor’s scripts.

### Troubleshooting
- **Refresh the page** – sometimes the edit flag isn’t set correctly.
- **Check permissions** – ensure your user role includes `:editor` rights.
- **Inspect network requests** – a 403 response indicates a permission issue.
- **Clear cache** – `Ctrl+Shift+R` (hard reload) often resolves stale assets.
